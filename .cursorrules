# Project Summary
This project is a static landing page built using Astro and Tailwind CSS. It is for a mobile app called "Chrima" which helps users track and manage their expenses and subscriptions.

# Goals
- Create a clean, modern, simple, mobile-responsive landing page.
- Prioritize SEO, fast loading, and good Lighthouse scores.
- Include key sections: Hero, Features, Screenshots, App Store links, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service.
- No interactivity or client-side JavaScript unless absolutely necessary.
- Focus on semantic HTML and accessible design.
- Minimal use of external libraries or heavy components.

# Styling Rules
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only (avoid writing custom CSS unless needed).
- Ensure all sections are responsive from mobile (sm) to desktop (lg/xl).
- Use `max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4` for consistent layout width and padding.
- Use `text-gray-700` or `text-gray-900` for readable body text.

# Layout Guidelines
- Use a base layout (`BaseLayout.astro`) to include shared head tags, header, and footer.
- Metadata (title, description, og:image, etc.) should be passed via Astro.props and used in the layout head.
- Pages: `/`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`

# Development Notes
- No React is used in this project (Astro only).
- Tailwind IntelliSense should be enabled.
- Deployment target is Vercel with static output.
